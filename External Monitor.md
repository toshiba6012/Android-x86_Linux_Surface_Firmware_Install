For external monitor use for Surface you can add to the Kernel commandline video= eDP-1:d that will disable the touch screen the difference between Android-x86 and Linux is for Android your video= can be blank but Linux has to be specific like video= HDMI-A-1:e
This command is useful for Android-x86 since it only has one display. For 4K monitors it is a better experience with DPI set at 320 this can be done at the end of the kernel command line like this DPI=320 or go to GooglePlay and install a DPI changer apk.
